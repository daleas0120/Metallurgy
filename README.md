Jupyter Notebooks and other small scripts for calculating physical quantities related to metals

## Notebooks
1. ```Heats_of_Formation.ipynb```: Implements a variation of Miedema's Model for ternary alloys from [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11661-016-3533-4).
2. ```TightBinding_w_SKparam.ipynb```: Implements a simple Tight Binding calculation using the [PythTB package](http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/pythtb/index.html#) with the [SKext2PythTB extension](https://github.com/TomushT/SKext2PythTB).
